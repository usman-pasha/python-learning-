# Variable Names

# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
# A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

# 1. Legal variable names:
myvar = "usman pasha"
my_var = "usman pasha"
_my_var = "usman pasha"
myVar = "usman pasha"
MYVAR = "usman pasha"
myvar2 = "usman pasha"

# 2. Illegal variable names:

# 2myvar = "usman pasha"
# my-var = "usman pasha"
# my var = "usman pasha"

# Multi Words Variable Names
# Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.

# There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

# 1. Camel Case
# Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

myVariableName = "Mohammed Siraj"

# 2. Pascal Case
# Each word starts with a capital letter:

MyVariableName = "Mohammed Siraj"

# 3. Snake Case
# Each word is separated by an underscore character:

my_variable_name = "Mohammed Siraj"
